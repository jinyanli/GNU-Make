This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Jinyan Li (jli134@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Hairong Wu (hwu27@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individuals effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Jinyan Li spent 20 hours working alone.
Hairong Wu spent 18 hours working alone.
We spent 15 hours working together.
Jinyan Li spent 5 hours driving.
Hairong Wu spent 5 hours driving.
